Abstract

Introduction: Remote cerebellar hemorrhage is a rare complication of spinal surgery. Although loss of cerebrospinal
fluid seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this complication, the detailed mechanism of remote
cerebellar hemorrhage after spinal surgery remains unclear. We report the case of a patient with remote cerebellar
hemorrhage following thoracic spinal surgery of an intradural extramedullary tumor and discuss this entity with
reference to the literature.
Case presentation: A 57-year-old Japanese woman presented to our hospital with back pain, dysuria, and numbness
of both legs. A neurological examination was performed, and imaging was performed with ordinary radiography,
magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Her magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an intradural
extramedullary tumor at the T3 level. A tumor resection and T1-T5 pedicle screw fixation were performed. Twelve hours
after spinal surgery, she complained of unexpected dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. A total of 850mL of serosanguineous
fluid had been drained at that time, and drainage was stopped. An urgent brain computed tomography scan showed a
cerebellar hemorrhage. She was treated conservatively, and was able to leave hospital six weeks after the initial operation,
without any neurological deficits except for slight ataxia.
Conclusions: Remote cerebellar hemorrhage has to be suspected when unexpected neurological signs occur after spinal
surgery. If an excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid drains from the drainage tube after spinal surgery, drainage should
be stopped.

Introduction
Remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) following spinal
surgery is a rare complication [1-25]. Although loss of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of this complication [1-25], the detailed
mechanism of RCH after spinal surgery remains unclear.
Here, we present a case of RCH after thoracic spinal sur-
gery for an intradural extramedullary tumor, along with
a review of previously reported cases and a discussion of
the mechanism of RCH.

Case presentation
A 57-year-old Japanese woman, with no past medical
history, presented to our institution with a one-year
history of abdominal pain, a two-month history of back
pain, numbness of both her legs, and a one-month
history of dysuria. She initially reported abdominal pain
and underwent extensive gastroenterological evaluation
at another hospital, including an esophagogastroduode-
noscopy, which was unremarkable.

Her physical examination revealed no motor weakness
and normal tendon reflexes. She felt hypoesthesia below
the umbilicus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) re-
sults demonstrated a large intradural extramedullary
mass at the T3 level that was compressing her spinal
cord from the ventral side (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Preoperative magnetic resonance images. Sagittal T1-weighted (a) and T2-weighted (b) magnetic resonance images of the thoracic
spine, demonstrating an intradural extramedullary mass anterior to the spinal cord at the T3 level. The mass was iso-intense on T1-weighted
imaging and T2-weighted imaging. Axial T1-weighted (c) and T2-weighted (d) magnetic resonance images show that the tumor seemed to be
completely covered by the spinal cord.

The intradural extramedullary tumor was resected
through a laminectomy of T2-T4 and a facetectomy of
T2-T3 and T3-T4 in the prone position under transcra-
nial motor-evoked potential (MEP) monitoring. As the
tumor was completely covered by her spinal cord, it was
surgically removed by rotation of the spinal cord using
tenting of the dentate ligament. After tumor resection,
the dura that adhered to the tumor was cauterized. A
watertight repair of the dura was performed, using fibrin
glue to avoid CSF leakage. A T1-T5 pedicle screw fix-
ation was performed (Figure 2). Abnormal MEP signals
were observed on her left leg during and after the tumor
resection. A subfascial drain was put in place, with

negative pressure. After she woke the motor power was
weakened to grade three to four in her left knee and
ankle. The total operating time was 4 hours 39 minutes,
and the amount of bleeding was 108g. The histological
diagnosis of the tumor was a meningioma.

Twelve hours after surgery, she developed nausea and
confusion, and her clinical status deteriorated with loss
of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score of seven).
A total of 850mL serosanguineous fluid had been
drained at that time, and drainage was stopped. An
emergency brain computed tomography (CT) scan dem-
onstrated an acute cerebellar hemorrhage in the superior
folia of the cerebellar hemispheres (Figure 3). An MRI

scan demonstrated a herniation of the cerebellar tonsils
(Figure 4a, b). She was treated conservatively with
anti-edema and antihypertensive drugs, and her clinical
status improved gradually. After removal of the drain,
there was no CSF leakage. The results of her follow-up
CT scan performed one week later showed that her
hematoma and brain edema were decreased. Twelve
days later, the results of her follow-up MRI scan showed
ascent of the cerebellum to the normal position (Figure 4c,
d). At six weeks after surgery, she had slight ataxia and was
discharged with a cane. At her one-year follow-up assess-
ment, she had a normal neurological examination except
for hypoesthesia of the right leg, and there was no CSF
collection visible on her MRI scan.

Discussion
Our case report has two characteristics. First, this case of
thoracic meningioma that was located anterior to the spinal
cord presented with a one-year history of undiagnosed
abdominal pain. Lyons et al. [26] reported a similar case
presenting as chronic abdominal pain. Second, although
the tumor (which completely covered the spinal cord) was
totally removed with a posterior surgical approach, our
patient had some left lower extremity weakness postopera-
tively that improved gradually. A total resection of intra-
dural extramedullary tumors located anterior to the spinal
cord can be performed using an isolated posterior ap-
proach, with rotation of the spinal cord and tenting of the
dentate ligament [27,28].

RCHs are rare and dramatic complications can follow
spinal surgery. Prevention is important, because RCHs
sometimes follow a fatal course. Sporadic cases have
been published since the first description by Chadduck
[4]. At the time of writing, 32 cases of RCH after spinal
surgery have been reported in the English-language
literature (Table 1). Including the present case, the 33
cases consisted of 23 women and 10 men, with an age
range of 36 to 85 years (mean: 60.9 years). Initial surgery
was performed at the lumbar spine in 21 cases, thoracic
spine in six, cervical spine in five, and thoracolumbar
spine in one. A dural tear during surgery was present
in 26 cases, but was not noticed in seven cases. The
neurological symptoms were detected between 0 and
192 hours (mean: 45.7 hours) after surgery. A total of
16 RCHs were resolved with conservative treatment,
but three patients died or developed serious paresis

[1-3,5,8,10,11,15,19,21-23]. However, in severe cases, emer-
gency surgical
intervention with ventricular drainage
or posterior fossa craniotomy was needed. Cranial
surgery was performed in 14 patients, nine of whom
improved, and five died or had serious paresis after
surgery [4,6,7,9,11-14,17,18,20,24,25].

RCH occurs in patients with a dural tear and CSF
leakage, whether occult or not. It is thus believed that
perioperative and/or postoperative CSF losses, leading to
cranial hypotension, represent
the main contributing
factor in RCH [1,8,12]. The exact pathophysiology of
RCH is still controversial. It is suggested that transient
stretching and occlusion of superior cerebellar veins,
resulting from downward cerebellar displacement under
conditions of
intracranial hypotension, may lead to
cerebellar hemorrhagic infarction [8,20]. It is also sug-
gested that cerebellar sag can directly cause tearing and

hematoma formation. However, if too much serosangui-
neous fluid drains postoperatively, stopping drainage or
removing the drainage tube should be considered to
prevent intracranial hypotension. Removal of the drain
restores the normal CSF flow dynamics, allowing the
cerebellum to resume its normal position [1]. Friedman
et al. [8] described a 56-year-old woman with postopera-
tive RCH whose headache resolved when suction drainage
of the wound was discontinued. Thus, considering our case
and the published literature, we suggest stopping drainage

The loss of CSF should be restricted and controlled,
because intracranial hypotension may be the initial cause
of RCH. Closed wound suction drainage is recom-
mended for spinal surgery, because a postoperative drain
theoretically reduces the risk of infection and/or wound
breakdown by decompressing the site of postoperative

when RCH is suspected based on the patient’s complaints,
including nausea and headache, and/or if an excessive
amount of serosanguineous fluid has been drained postop-
eratively. This complication can be prevented by observing
the amount of drainage fluid. If an excessive amount of
fluid is drained, drainage should be stopped or converted to
a gravity drain instead of a suction drain.

Conclusions
RCH is a rare postoperative complication of spinal sur-
gery. RCH must be suspected when intracranial symp-
toms or unexpected neurological signs occur after spinal
surgery. If an excessive amount of serosanguineous fluid
is found coming from the drainage tube postoperatively,
drainage should be stopped.
